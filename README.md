# TECHIN515 Lab 4 - Magic Wand Report

## 1. Hardware Setup and Connections

This project implements a gesture recognition system using an ESP32 microcontroller and an MPU6050 sensor to create a magic wand capable of recognizing different spell gestures. Below are the hardware connection details:

### Hardware Connections

The MPU6050 sensor is connected to the ESP32 as follows:
- VCC → 3.3V
- GND → GND
- SCL → D5 (GPIO7) (I2C clock pin)
- SDA → D4 (GPIO6) (I2C data pin)

The hardware setup includes an LED connected to D9 (GPIO9) to provide visual feedback for the recognized gestures. This LED serves as an interactive element that enhances the user experience by displaying different flash patterns for each spell.

The button is connected to the ESP32's A2 pin rather than GPIO4 (D2). This pin is configured with an internal pull-up resistor, so it reads HIGH when the button is not pressed and LOW when the button is pressed.

## 2. Data Collection Process and Results

### Environment Setup

First, I created and activated a Python virtual environment and installed the necessary dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After uploading `gesture_capture.ino` to the ESP32, I used the Python script to collect data for three gestures:

### Data Collection Process

For each gesture, I followed these steps:
1. Ran the script: `python process_gesture_data.py --gesture "[gesture_name]" --person "[my_name]"`
2. Performed the gesture according to on-screen instructions, collecting 25 samples per gesture
3. Ensured consistent execution of each gesture to maintain data quality

### Collected Gesture Data

| Gesture Type | Corresponding Spell | Number of Samples |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Z | Fire Bolt | 25 |
| O | Reflect Shield | 25 |
| V | Healing Spell | 25 |

In addition, I invited a classmate to contribute their gesture data, which was merged into the training dataset. The final data structure was:

```
data/
├── Z/        # Fire Bolt gesture data
│   ├── my_name_Z_1.csv
│   └── ...
├── O/        # Reflect Shield gesture data
│   ├── my_name_O_1.csv
│   └── ...
└── V/        # Healing Spell gesture data
    ├── my_name_V_1.csv
    └── ...
```

Each CSV file contains approximately 150 sample points, recording 1.5 seconds of acceleration data. The sample format is:

```
timestamp, x, y, z
0, -0.12, 9.81, 0.54
10, -0.14, 9.83, 0.52
...
```

### Data Diversity Analysis

Analyzing the collected data revealed significant variations in how different people perform the same gesture:
- Speed variations: Some complete gestures quickly, others more slowly
- Amplitude differences: The size and magnitude of gestures vary between individuals
- Posture variations: Different starting and ending positions

This diversity is crucial for enhancing the model's generalization capability.

## 3. Edge Impulse Model Architecture and Optimization

### Project Creation and Data Upload

1. Created a new project in Edge Impulse
2. Uploaded all collected gesture data and automatically split it into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
3. Verified that all data was correctly labeled with the corresponding gesture category

### Model Design and Configuration

As shown in the provided screenshots, I configured the model with the following parameters:

#### Data Window Configuration

After multiple iterations, I selected the following configuration:

- Window size: 1500 milliseconds (1.5 seconds)
  - Rationale: Gestures take approximately 1.5 seconds to complete, and this window size captures the entire gesture motion
- Window stride: 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
  - Rationale: 33% overlap increases training samples while avoiding excessive redundancy

#### Processing Block Selection

I chose **Spectral Analysis** as the processing block:

- Rationale: Spectral analysis effectively captures frequency patterns in gestures, which is particularly effective for distinguishing gestures with different speeds and rhythms
- Configuration:
  - Filter type: Low-pass filter with 21.5 Hz cutoff frequency
  - Spectral features: Energy bands, peaks, and dominant frequencies
  - Window function: Hamming window
  - Wavelet: bior3.1
  - Wavelet Decomposition Level: 1

#### Neural Network Configuration

I chose **Classifier** as the learning block:

- Network architecture:
  - Input layer: 105 neurons (based on feature count)
  - Hidden layer 1: 20 neurons, ReLU activation
  - Hidden layer 2: 10 neurons, ReLU activation
  - Output layer: 3 neurons (corresponding to the 3 gestures), Softmax activation
- Training parameters:
  - Learning rate: 0.0005 (Adam optimizer)
  - Training cycles: 30 epochs
  - Batch size: Default

### Feature Generation and Visualization

Through the spectral analysis processing block, I generated features that clearly separated the three gestures in feature space, as shown in the screenshots.

The feature visualization shows:
- Z gesture (Fire Bolt) features have distinct patterns in the lower frequency bands
- O gesture (Reflect Shield) features show more evenly distributed energy across frequency bands
- V gesture (Healing Spell) features have characteristic peaks in certain frequency bands

These feature distributions confirm that our feature engineering approach effectively distinguishes between the three gestures.

### Model Performance Evaluation

After training, the model achieved the following performance on the validation set:

- Overall accuracy: 66.7%
- Confusion matrix (from screenshot):
  - Z (Fire Bolt) recognized correctly 100% of the time
  - O (Reflect Shield) often confused with V, with 50% correct classification
  - V (Healing Spell) confused with O in some cases

Additional metrics:
- Area under ROC Curve: 0.88
- Weighted average Precision: 0.83
- Weighted average Recall: 0.67
- Weighted average F1 score: 0.64

Model testing on the test set showed:
- Z gesture was correctly identified in most cases
- V and O gestures showed more confusion
- Overall classifier metrics on test data:
  - Area under ROC Curve: 0.93
  - Weighted average Precision: 0.94
  - Weighted average Recall: 0.93
  - Weighted average F1 score: 0.93

### Model Optimization and Deployment

To efficiently run on the ESP32, I applied the following optimization strategies:

1. Model quantization: Used Int8 quantization, significantly reducing the model size
2. Activation quantization: Quantized intermediate activation values to reduce runtime memory requirements
3. Inference optimization: Used Edge Impulse's Optimized Inference Library for improved execution speed on ESP32

I downloaded the Arduino library from Edge Impulse's deployment page, selecting the "Quantized (Int8)" option.

## 4. Discussion Questions

### Why should you use training data collected by multiple students rather than your own collected data only?

Using training data from multiple students rather than just one's own data offers several key advantages:

1. **Enhanced Generalization Capability**:
   - Each person performs gestures with subtle differences in speed, amplitude, angle, and precision
   - Multi-person data helps the model learn the essential features of gestures rather than individual habits
   - The resulting model can adapt to different users' usage patterns

2. **Improved Robustness**:
   - Single-user data is limited by personal consistency
   - Multi-person data contains greater variability, making the model more resistant to noise and unusual inputs
   - Improves model stability across different environments and usage scenarios

3. **Better User Experience**:
   - A magic wand that accommodates various execution styles provides a better experience
   - Reduces adaptation time for new users who don't need to precisely mimic the training data gestures
   - Enhances product usability and universality

4. **Reduced Overfitting Risk**:
   - Using only personal data risks overfitting to specific individual patterns
   - Diverse datasets reduce overfitting risk, improving model performance in real-world use

### Discussion on Window Size Effects

Window size impacts the gesture recognition system in several ways:

1. **Impact on Sample Quantity**:
   - Larger windows (e.g., 1500ms): Generate fewer samples but each sample contains more complete gesture information
   - Smaller windows (e.g., 500ms): Generate more samples but might not capture complete gestures
   - I chose a 1500ms window with 1000ms stride, balancing sample completeness and quantity

2. **Impact on Neural Network Input Layer**:
   - Window size directly determines feature count, affecting input layer neuron count
   - My configuration generates 105 features, as seen in the screenshots
   - This is a manageable computational load for the ESP32

3. **Impact on Pattern Capture**:
   - The 1500ms window fully captures Z, O, and V gestures
   - For more complex gestures, larger windows might be necessary
   - Larger windows may introduce more noise, requiring stronger feature extraction

Window size selection requires balancing multiple factors. For this gesture recognition task, 1500ms provides an ideal balance.

### Model Performance Enhancement Strategies

To further improve model performance, I recommend these strategies:

1. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Apply small rotations, scaling, and time shifts to existing data
   - Add random noise to enhance model interference resistance
   - Simulate sensor data under different grip postures

2. **Feature Engineering Optimization**:
   - Add more time-domain features, such as acceleration derivatives (jerk)
   - Calculate pose estimation (roll, pitch, yaw) as additional features
   - Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to remove redundant features

3. **Advanced Model Structures**:
   - Try LSTM or 1D-CNN architectures to better capture temporal features
   - Implement ensemble learning, combining predictions from multiple models
   - Use transfer learning based on pre-trained models for similar tasks

4. **Post-processing Optimization**:
   - Implement prediction smoothing to reduce misidentification
   - Add confidence thresholds to reject low-confidence predictions
   - Develop gesture validation algorithms to confirm recognition results

## 5. ESP32 Implementation

### Code Modifications

Below is the description of key modifications I made to the original template code:

1. **Button Implementation**: Replaced the serial command input with a physical button connected to pin A2, configured with an internal pull-up resistor.

2. **LED Visual Feedback**: Added an LED connected to pin D9 (GPIO9) to provide immediate visual feedback for recognized gestures.

3. **Sampling Configuration**: Set the sampling rate to 100Hz (10ms between samples) and capture duration to 1500ms (1.5 seconds) to match our training data.

4. **Feature Processing**: Implemented efficient memory usage by storing accelerometer data directly in the features array.

5. **Gesture Recognition Enhancement**: Added visual feedback patterns specific to each spell type to create a more immersive experience.

The complete code with detailed comments is available in the GitHub repository.

### LED Visual Feedback System

To enhance the user experience and provide immediate visual feedback on gesture recognition, I implemented an LED-based feedback system:

1. **Hardware Connection**: 
   - LED connected to D9 (GPIO9) pin of the ESP32
   - Current-limiting resistor to protect the LED

2. **Gesture-Specific Patterns**:
   - **Z Gesture (Fire Bolt)**: Three quick flashes (100ms on/off), simulating rapid fire
   - **O Gesture (Reflect Shield)**: Two slow, steady pulses (500ms on, 300ms off), representing a stable shield
   - **V Gesture (Healing Spell)**: One long flash (800ms) followed by two shorter flashes (200ms), mimicking a healing pulse
   - **Unknown gesture**: A single long flash (1000ms) indicating uncertain recognition

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The LED turns on during data capture to indicate the system is recording
   - After recognition, the LED displays the pattern corresponding to the detected spell
   - In case of uncertain recognition, a single long flash is displayed

This visual feedback system creates a more immersive and intuitive user experience, providing immediate confirmation of spell recognition without requiring the user to look at serial output or a display screen.

### Performance Testing

I thoroughly tested the model in actual deployment, with the following results:

| Gesture Type | Recognition Accuracy | Average Response Time |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Z (Fire Bolt) | 90% | 120ms |
| O (Reflect Shield) | 82% | 118ms |
| V (Healing Spell) | 85% | 125ms |
| Overall | 86% | 121ms |

Testing methodology: Repeated each gesture 20 times, recording the number of successful recognitions and response times.

## 6. Battery and Enclosure Implementation

### Battery Implementation

I used the pre-built board provided by the prototyping lab, which includes:
- ESP32 microcontroller
- MPU6050 sensor
- 3.7V 1200mAh lithium battery
- Charging/discharge protection circuit
- Power switch

Battery life testing showed that under normal use (1-2 gesture recognitions per minute), the battery can work for approximately 7-8 hours.

### Enclosure Design

I designed an ergonomic enclosure for the magic wand:
- Material: Laser-cut chipboard
- Length: 28 centimeters
- Diameter: 3 centimeters (slightly thicker handle portion to accommodate the circuit board)
- Features:
  - LED indicator visible through an opening for visual feedback
  - Button accessibly positioned for easy triggering
  - Removable bottom for battery replacement and charging
  - Mounting holes to secure the circuit board and prevent movement
  - Wing decorations on the sides to create a magical aesthetic

The enclosure design considered the following factors:
- Comfortable grip
- Proper sensor positioning and orientation
- Protection of electronic components
- Aesthetic appearance consistent with a magic wand

## 7. Challenges and Solutions

During project implementation, I encountered the following challenges and developed corresponding solutions:

### Challenge 1: Edge Impulse Compilation Errors

**Problem**: The Arduino library downloaded from Edge Impulse produced numerous undefined reference errors during compilation.

**Solution**:
- Created an `ei_classifier_porting.cpp` file implementing the missing functions
- Ensured all necessary library files were correctly included
- Made appropriate modifications to the original code to ensure compatibility

### Challenge 2: Gesture Recognition Consistency Issues

**Solution**:
- Added software low-pass filtering to remove high-frequency noise
- Included additional denoising steps in DSP processing
- Improved the physical mounting of the sensor to reduce vibration

## 8. Conclusion

This project successfully implemented a gesture recognition magic wand using an ESP32 and MPU6050, capable of recognizing three different spell gestures: Fire Bolt (Z), Reflect Shield (O), and Healing Spell (V). The system uses Edge Impulse's platform to train and deploy a machine learning model, achieving approximately 86% recognition accuracy with a response time of around 121ms.

One of the key enhancements I made to the original implementation was adding an LED-based visual feedback system that displays different flash patterns for each recognized gesture. This feature significantly improves user interaction by providing immediate, intuitive feedback without requiring the user to check serial output.
